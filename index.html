   <h2>What is DevOps</h2>
   <!-- <h3>cncnzdvnznvnzvjnkmnsnnvdkjnsvksjvvksdjsjk</h3> -->
   <p>DevOps is an approach to working that emphasizes the quick, incremental, and continuous delivery of products. <br /> term DevOps combines the words "development" and "operations." In practice, it's a union between the development <br /> and operations teams. DevOps is often thought of as a process, a culture, or a set of principles that enables organizations <br />  to deliver products quickly and continuously.</p>

   <h2>The Lifecycle of DevOps</h2>
   <p>The DevOps lifecycle provides a structure to the project in such a way that it gives the team,<br /> or the person working on it a view of what comes next.  By following this approach,<br /> one can develop a quality project in very little time and with high reliability.<br /> One cannot simply say that he/she knows DevOps without knowing its lifecycle.<br /> Here are the various stages of the DevOps lifecycle along with a diagram below: <br />
    Continuous Development <br />
    Continuous Integration <br />
    Continuous Testing <br />
    Continuous Monitoring <br />
    Continuous Feedback <br />
    Continuous Deployment <br />
    Continuous Operations <br />
    <!-- <h1>shvvvxvzkhhshuhsravanfnahuuasdkhjsbvhshbsbsbdvsbbc</h1> -->
    <h2>Continuous Development</h2>
    <p>The continuous development phase involves planning and coding the product the team is developing.<br /> In this phase of the DevOps lifecycle, the vision and goal of the project are set, and developers start to code.<br /> The integration of development and operations teams helps in planning the work accordingly, <br />increasing the productivity of the team. In this phase, they use tools, such as Git, CVS, Slack, etc. <br />
    
         

        Before DevOps, the concept of the cloud was in just its initial stages, <br /> and companies had to use fixed hardware and software allocations they had planned for the project. <br /> Now, with cloud services in place, they can plan to increase or decrease the resource allocation for  <br />the project using cloud resources within their budget.
        
        With the adaptation of DevOps, there occurred  <br />an increase in the usage of good coding methodologies and versioning systems. Take Git, for example.  <br />Using Git and its commands, users can maintain version control for keeping track of the changes made <br /> to a set of files so that, whenever the newer versions have serious bugs or critical  vulnerabilities in them,  <br />the team can revert to previous versions.</p>
